# Protecting Secrets with Oslo.Config and HashiCorp Vault

Applications and services rely on configuration in order to interact with each other and to function according to a purpose. Config files are widely used to separate configuration from code as configuration varies across deployments while code does not.

OpenStack Common Libraries (Oslo) has an alternative to Python's standard module ConfigParser called [oslo.config]. It supports config through command line arguments, environment variables, config files and has an API for configuration source drivers.

There is also [Castellan], a generic secret manager interface maintained by Oslo, that aims to enable projects to use deployment specific secret managers avoiding vendor lock-in.

The motivation of this work is to show how to use oslo.config to fetch sensitive configuration data (secrets) from places that are better equipped to deal with them.


## Problem description

Best practices say that passwords and other secrets should not be stored as plain text in config files and some regulations even enforce this practice as mandatory.

Although we can rely on file system permissions to restrict access to config files, their content can still be accidentally shared, checked into revision control, or printed to a console or log file, without having all sensitive data stripped out of it.

Also, popularization of containers and public clouds increase the risk of data getting compromised as we lose control over what else runs on the same machine.

There are proper solutions for storing this kind of sensitive data called secret managers. They have features to handle access control, password rotation, data encryption and decryption, X.509 certificates and can also interface with Hardware Security Modules (HSM) if the security requirements are set that high.


## oslo.config

A config option in oslo.config is identified by its name and group, when the group is not defined, the option automatically belongs to the DEFAULT group. Below we can see a sample config file with three options and the minimal code required to register them:

```ini
[DEFAULT]
foo=bar

[db]
user=admin
pswd=AyqUJtFu4Zam
```

```python
from oslo_config import cfg

conf = cfg.ConfigOpts()

conf.register_cli_opt(cfg.StrOpt("foo"))
conf.register_opt(cfg.StrOpt("user"), "db")
conf.register_opt(cfg.StrOpt("pswd"), "db")
```

In the example above, values can be accessed at conf.foo, conf.db.user and conf.db.pswd after the option values are loaded with a call to conf like conf().

Values from environment variables takes precedence over values from config files. Oslo.config looks for variables in os.environ named like OS_{GROUP}__{NAME}.

To enable options to be defined via command line arguments, they must register with register_cli_opt() so they are exposed to the cli as --{group}-{name}. Values from the command line arguments have the highest precedence in oslo.config.

For configuration source drivers, a config option DEFAULT.config_source is used to define extra sources. Source drivers are responsible for providing config values when they are not present in: cli args, env variables and config files.

Oslo.config will check for defined option values using the following order of precedence:

1. Checks the command line arguments in case the option was exposed to the cli. For conf.foo, looks for an argument named --foo as DEFAULT is omitted for cli.
2. Checks for an environment variable with the pattern OS_{GROUP}__{NAME}. For conf.foo, it will look for a variable named OS_DEFAULT__FOO.
3. Checks if the option was defined in one of the loaded config files.
4. Asks the configuration sources in the order they appear in config_source.
5. Returns None or the default value in case the config option has one.


## Proposed solution

To minimize impact on codebases, we used the source drivers API to implement the castellan driver. This driver is responsible for retrieving config values from secret managers supported by Castellan and has the following options:

**driver=castellan**

The name of the driver that can load this configuration source.

**config_file**

A config file required by Castellan to talk to a secret manager.

**mapping_file**

A pseudo config file that maps options to secret_ids instead of values. The driver uses secret_ids in Castellan to fetch option values stored in the secret manager.

The proof of concept (PoC) for this work aims to fulfill the following criteria:

1. Have a sample application fetching config values through oslo.config;
2. Strip out secrets from its config file;
3. Store those secrets in a secret manager;
4. Have the sample application to fetch secrets from the secret manager without any change to its code.

## Conclusions

By fetching option values through the castellan driver, one can include extra layers of protection and take advantage of features provided by the secret manager in use.

We were able to generate temporary credentials for multiple nodes being able to revoke access to a single node without compromising the whole deployment. Also, the lifespan of a secret can be fine-tuned to minimize the attack window using compromised keys and credentials.

Having the secrets to live in a single place makes the process of credentials rotation easier as the new credentials only has to be updated in one place instead of in every config files that requires it.


## Future work

With the proper use of policies, we think that orchestrators could trigger secrets generation whenever spawning new nodes, having unique cryptographic keys and credentials per node.

The next step in our roadmap is to integrate this work into TripleO, a program aimed at installing, upgrading and operating OpenStack clouds using OpenStack's own cloud facilities as the foundations to automate fleet management at datacenter scale.

Developers interested in using another solution as an extra source of configuration data can implement their own drivers following this [spec].
